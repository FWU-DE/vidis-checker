Afterwards:
Begin with searching for legal pages on the website, followed by a general browsing phase.

Step 1: Search for Legal Pages (Datenschutz, Impressum, AGB)
------------------------------------------------------------------
Look for something like "Datenschutz" (Privacy Policy), "Impressum" (Legal Notice), or "AGB" (Terms and Conditions).
These are often located in the header or footer of the page or in the settings menu.

You have 3 options:

1. If found:
    - Click on each (Datenschutz, Impressum, AGB) and save the entire content of each page as a PDF in the current task folder.
    - Use the action `save_page_as_pdf` with one of the following labels: `privacy_policy`, `imprint`, or `terms_of_use`.

2. If not found:
    - Navigate through the website using menus, links, or buttons to look for them.
    - Continue searching up to 3 levels deep into the website if necessary.

3. Cookie Banner:
    - If a cookie banner appears asking you to accept or decline cookies:
        a. Call the `cookie_handler` function.
        b. Afterwards, explicitly decline cookies (e.g., "Alle ablehnen", "Ablehnen").

Step 2: Browse the Website
------------------------------
Once legal pages have been handled or thoroughly searched for, continue browsing the website to get a general overview:

- Click on different visible menu items, homepage sections, or internal links.
- Visit key pages that are relevant. Interactions with footer elements are most likely not relevant.
- Explore unique internal pages throughout the website.
- Avoid repeatedly visiting the same pages or looping.

Step 3: Completion Condition
-------------------------------
You are done with this task when:
- You have saved available legal pages (Datenschutz, Impressum, AGB)
AND ALSO:
- You have thoroughly browsed the website.
